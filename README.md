My objective was to develop a web application using the Flask framework that predicts and estimates an individual's annual income (whether it is greater or less than 50K). The application enables users to input their information and receive an estimated annual income.

To accomplish this, I worked on preprocessing the data by applying various data cleaning and preparation techniques. 
Additionally, I conducted exploratory analysis to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.

Next, I utilized different techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to train predictive models on the dataset. I assessed the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics.

Finally, I successfully implemented the predictive model into a user-friendly web application, allowing users to input their details and obtain an estimate of their annual income. 
I'm excited to see the application in action and help users gain insights into their financial situation!
Feel free to make any further adjustments to personalize the summary according to your project. Best of luck with your application!
